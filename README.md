# Therapy_Prediction_Thesis
The code necessary to replicate the results of my undergraduate thesis dealing with predicting the distress scores of psychotherapy clients based on a time series of previous scores

Assuming the proper raw datafiles are included, you can replicate the results of the paper by running all the cells in
main.ipynb, in order, until you reach the section on LSTMs; these were trained on a supercomputer.
There are instructions there for how to run the LSTM code on an analogous machine.
